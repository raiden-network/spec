Pathfinding Service
###################

Overview
========

A path finding service having a global view on a token network can provide suitable payment paths for Raiden nodes.
Raiden nodes can request paths via public endpoints and pay per request. The service will keep its view on the
token network updated by listening to blockchain events and a public matrix room where current capacities and
fees are being published. Nodes will publish this information in order to advertise their channels for mediation.

Assumptions & Goals
===================

* The PFS should be able to handle a similar amount of active nodes as currently present in Ethereum (~20,000).
* Nodes are incentivized to publicly report their current capacities and fees to "advertise" their channels.
* Uncooperative nodes are dropped by the PFS, so paths provided by the service can be expected to work most of the time.
* No guarantees are or can be made about the feasibility of the path with respect to node uptime or neutrality.


High-Level-Description
======================

A node can request a list of possible paths from start point to endpoint for a given transfer value.
The ``get_paths`` method implements the bi-directional Dijkstra algorithm to return a given number of paths
for a mediated transfer of a given value. The design regards the Raiden network as an unidirectional
weighted graph, where the weights of the edges/channels are the sum of multiple penalty terms:

* a base weight of 1 per edge, to incentivize short paths
* a term proportional to the mediation fees for that channel
* if the edge is included in a route, all following routes will get a penalty
  if they include the same edge. This increases the diversity of routes and
  reduces the likelihood that multiple routes fail due to the same problem.

See `Routing Preferences`_ for information on how to configure the trade-off between these penalties.


Public REST API
===============

A pathfinding service must provide the following endpoints. The interface has to be versioned.

The examples provided for each of the endpoints is for communication with a REST endpoint.


.. _pfs_api_paths:

``POST api/v1/<token_network_address>/paths``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The method will do ``max_paths`` iterations of Dijkstras algorithm on the last-known state of the Raiden
Network (regarded as directed weighted graph) to return ``max_paths`` different paths for a mediated transfer of ``value``.

* Checks if an edge (i.e. a channel) has ``capacity > value``, else ignores it.

* Applies on the fly changes to the graph's weights - depends on ``DIVERSITY_PEN_DEFAULT`` from ``config``, to penalize edges which are part of a path that is returned already.

Routing Preferences
"""""""""""""""""""

The PFS will search for routes that are:

* short
* cheap
* diverse (using different channels for different routes when multiple routes are returned)

Since these goals can be conflicting, a trade-off between them has to be
chosen. This is done by assigning a penalty to all undesired properties of a
channel, summing up these penalties across all channels used in a route and
then choosing the route with the lowest total penalty.

When requesting a route, the calculated penalties depend on the
``diversity_penalty`` and ``fee_penalty`` parameters. If those parameters are
omitted, reasonable defaults are chosen. A ``diversity_penalty`` of 5 means that
a channel which has already been used in previous route is as bad as adding 5
more channels to the path which have not been used, yet. A ``fee_penalty`` of 100
means that spending 1 RDN is as bad as adding 100 more channels to the route
(or that spending 0.01 RDN is as bad as adding one more channel).

Errors
""""""

Each error consists of three parts:

* ``errors``: a human readable error message
* ``error_code``: a machine readable identifier for the type of error
* ``error_details``: additional information on the failure, e.g. values that
  caused the failure or expected input values (can be empty for some errors)

Network Topology Updates
========================

The creation of new token networks can be followed by listening for ``TokenNetworkCreated`` events on the ``TokenNetworksRegistry`` contract.

To learn about updates of the network topology of a token network the PFS must
listen for the following events:

- ``ChannelOpenened``: Update the network to include the new channel
- ``ChannelClosed``: Remove the channel from the network


Capacity and Fee Updates
========================
Updates for channel capacities and fees are published over a public matrix room. Path finding services can pick these
capacity updates from there and update the topology represented internally.
The Raiden nodes that want to earn fees mediating payments would be incentivized to publish their capacity updates in
order to provide a path.

Routing feedback
================

In order to improve the calculated routes, the PFS requires feedback about the routes it provides to Raiden clients. For that reason the routing feedback mechanism is introduced.

When a client requests a route from a PFS (see :ref:`pfs_api_paths`), the PFS returns a *feedback token* together with the number of routes requested.
This feedback token is a UUID in version 4. The client stores it together with the payment id and then initiates the payment. Whenever a particular
route fails or the payment succeeds by using a certain route, this feedback is given to the PFS.

While the individual feedback cannot be trusted by the PFS, it can use general trends to improve it's routing algorithm, e.g. lowering the precedence or removing channels
from the routing table when payments including them often fail.
