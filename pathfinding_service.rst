Raiden Pathfinding Service Specification
########################################

Overview
========

A centralized path finding service that has a global view on a token network and provides suitable payment paths for Raiden nodes.

Assumptions
===========

* The pathfinding service in its current spec is a temporary solution.
* It should be able to handle a similar amount of active nodes as currently present in Ethereum (~20,000).
* Uncooperative nodes are dropped on the Raiden-level protocol, so paths provided by the service can be expected to work most of the time.
* User experience should be simple and free for sparse users with optional premium fee schedules for heavy users.
* No guarantees are or can be made about the feasibility of the path with respect to node uptime or neutrality.
* Hubs are incentivized to accurately report their current balances and fees to "advertise" their channels. Higher fees than reported would be rejected by the transfer initiator.
* Every pathfinding service is responsible for a single token network. Pathfinding services are scaled on process level to handle multiple token networks.


High-Level-Description
======================
A node can request a list of possible paths from start point to endpoint for a given transfer value.
The ``get_paths`` method implements the canonical Dijkstra algorithm to return a given number of paths
for a mediated transfer of a given value. The design regards the Raiden network as an unidirectional
weighted graph, where the default weights (and therefore the primary constraint of the optimization)
are the fees of each channel. Additionally we applied two heuristics to quantify desirable properties
of the resulting graph:

i) A hard coded parameter ``DIVERSITY_PEN_DEFAULT`` defined in the config; this value is added to each edge that is part of a returned path as a bias. This results in an output of "pseudo-disjoint" paths, i.e. the optimization will prefer paths with a minimal edge intersection. This should enable nodes to have a suitable amount of options for their payment routing in the case some paths are slow or broken. However, if a node has only one channel (i.e. a light client) payments could be routed through, the method will still return the specified ``number of paths``.


ii) The second heuristic is configurable via the optional argument ``bias``, which models the trade-off between speed and cost of mediated transfer; with default 0, ``get_paths`` will  optimize with respect to overall fees only (i.e. the cheapest path). On the other hand, with ``bias=1``, ``get_paths`` will look for paths with the minimal number of hops (i.e. the  -theoretical - fastest path). Any value in ``[0,1]`` is accepted, an appropriate value depends on the average ``channel_fee`` in the network (in simulations ``mean_fee`` gave decent results for the trade-off between speed and cost). The reasoning behind this heuristic is that a node may have different needs, w.r.t to good to be paid for - buying a potato should be fast, buying a yacht should incorporate low fees.

Public Interface
================

Definitions
-----------

The following data types are taken from the Raiden Core spec.

*Channel_Id*

* uint: channel_identifier

*Balance_Proof*

* uint64: nonce
* uint256: transferred_amount
* bytes32: locksroot
* uint256: channel_identifier
* address: token_network_address
* uint256: chain_id
* bytes32: additional_hash
* bytes: signature


*Lock*

* uint64: expiration
* uint256: locked_amount
* bytes32: secrethash

Public Endpoints
----------------

A path finding service must provide the following endpoints. The interface has to be versioned.

The examples provided for each of the endpoints is for communication with a REST endpoint.

``api/1/<token_network_address>/<channel_id>/balance``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Update the balance for the given channel with the provided balance proof. The receiver can be read from the balance proof.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Update the fee for the given channel, for the outgoing channel from the partner who signed the message.
A nonce is required to be incorporated in the signature for replay protection.

* Reconstructs the signers ``public_key`` of a requested fee update with coincurve's ``from_signature_and_message`` method.

* Derives the two ``channel_participants`` with ``from channel_id``. Checks if the signing ``public_key`` matches one of the ``channel participant``'s ``address`` or returns an error if the signature doesn't match.

``api/1/<token_network_address>/paths``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The method will do ``num_paths`` iterations of Dijkstras algorithm on the last-known state of the Raiden
Network (regarded as directed weighted graph) to return ``num_paths`` different paths for a mediated transfer of ``value``.

* Checks if an edge (i.e. a channel) has ``capacity > value``, else ignores it.

* Applies on the fly changes to the graph's weights - depends on ``DIVERSITY_PEN_DEFAULT`` from ``config``, to penalize edges which are part of a path that is returned already.

* Depends on a user preference via the ``bias`` argument, to decided the trade off between fee-level vs. path-length (i.e. cost vs. speed) - default ``bias = 0``, i.e. full fee minimization.

Implementation notes
====================

Network topology updates
------------------------

.. Note::
    A pathfinding service might want to cover multiple token networks. However,
    it always needs to cover the *RDN* token network in order to be able to
    provide routing information for payments.
    
    The creation of new token networks can be followed by listening for
    `TokenNetworkCreated` events on the `TokenNetworksRegistry` contract. 

To learn about updates of the network topology of a token network the PFS must
listen for the following events:

- `ChannelOpenened`: Update the network to include the new channel
- `ChannelClosed`: Remove the channel from the network

Additionally it must listen to the `ChannelNewDeposit` event in order to learn
about new deposits.

Updates for channel balances and fees are received over the designated API endpoints.

Future Work
===========

The methods will be rate-limited in a configurable way. If the rate limit is exceeded,
clients can be required to pay the path-finding service with RDN tokens via the Raiden Network.
The required path for this payment will be provided by the service for free. This enables a simple
user experience for light users without the need for additional on-chain transactions for channel
creations or payments, while at the same time monetizing extensive use of the API.
