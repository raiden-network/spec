Raiden Mediation Fee Specification
##################################

Overview
========

Mediation fees are used to incentivize people to mediate payments. There are (currently) three components:

- Flat fees
- Proportional fees
- Imbalance penalty fees

Nomenclature
============

In this description a simple mediation node is assumed. The incoming channel (for the mediated payment) is also called **payer channel** and the outgoing channel is also called **payee channel**. This scenario is shown in the following graphic:

::

               c
    --> a --> (M) --> b -->

- :math:`a` is the locked amount of the payer channel. This locked amount includes fees.
- :math:`b` is the locked amount of the payee channel. This locked amount includes fees for further hops.
- :math:`c` is a helper value for making the calculation of mediation fees simpler. It is not exposed to the user.


In the calculation the different fees are used.

- :math:`f` is the flat fee
- :math:`i` is the imbalance fee


Converting per-hop proportional fees in per-channel proportional fees
=====================================================================

User usually think about deducting mediation fees as an atomic action, so it's
easier to let them define a *per-hop* proportional mediation fee (called
:math:`p`). However, this setting then needs to be converted into a
*per-channel* proportional fee (called :math:`q`).

.. math::

    b(1+p) = b + bq + qb(1+p)  \\
    (1+p) = 1 + q + q(1+p)  \\
    q + q(1+p) = p \\
    q(2+p) = p \\
    q = \frac{p}{2+p}

Fee calculation
===============

There are two fundamental formula to relate :math:`a`, :math:`b` and :math:`c`.

1. :math:`a = c + aq + f + i`

2. :math:`c = b + bq + f + i`

The other fundamental relations are:

- :math:`a = c + {fee}_{in}`
- :math:`c = b + {fee}_{out}`

Forward calculation (as in the client)
--------------------------------------

For the fee calculation in the client, only :math:`a` is known and it needs to calculate :math:`c` and :math:`b.`.

From (1) follows:

.. math::

    {fee}_{in} = a - c = qa + f + i

From (2) follows:

.. math::

    c = b + bq + f + i \\
    b = \frac{c - f - i}{1+q}

This leads to

.. math::

    {fee}_{out} = c - b = c - \frac{c - f - i}{1+q}


Backward calculation (as in the PFS)
------------------------------------

In the case of fee calculation in the PFS, only :math:`b` is known and it needs to calculate :math:`c` and :math:`a`.

From (2) follows:

.. math::

    {fee}_{out} = c - b = bq + f + i

From (1) follows:

.. math::

    {fee}_{in} = a - c = \frac{c + f + i}{1-q} - c



Example
-------

Let's assume:

- :math:`f = 100`
- :math:`q = 0.1`
- :math:`c = 1200`
- :math:`b = 1000`

Now forward and backward calculation should let us recalculate :math:`b` or :math:`c`.

**Client**

.. math::

    {fee}_{out} = c - b = c - \frac{c - f - i}{1+q} = 1200 - \frac{1200 - 100}{1 + 0.1} = 200

**PFS**

.. math::

    {fee}_{out} = c - b = bq + f + i = 1000 * 0.1 + 100 = 200
